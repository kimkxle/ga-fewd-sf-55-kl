That's the power of external style sheets. one style sheet can be applied to the entire website. let's you update quicker. embeded webpage such as the tags <style></style> are rules that can only apply to single document. one page is wiped out the style is wiped out as well.

    What are the normalize.css and reset.css files? What are they used for?
    A: browsers have different style definitions. the normalize css helps render the pages across browsers. 

    normalize.css - main difference is that it keeps things consistent across browsers. normalize.css benefits: 1) preserves defaults styling; 2) corrects comment bugs vs reset.css; 3) doesn't clutter; 4) modular - breaks down indepedent sections; 5) more documented 
    
    reset.css - aims to remove all built-in browser styling. standard elements such as h1, h2, h3 etc.. will have no decoration at all, and you're forced to decorate it yourself.
